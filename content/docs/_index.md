This page contains a variety of documents and activities for people to learn more about Security Operations Centres, and the security field in general.

It is recommended to read the documents in this order:
- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](MITRE)\
The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is referred to by a lot of documents on this site. It is recommended to familiarise yourself with the framework before reading the other documents.
- [Security Correlation](security-correlation)\
Looking at logs and trying to turn them into useful information can be difficult. Here we give some examples on how to link different logs and identify the details of an attack.
- [Real Attack Analysis](real-attack-analysis)\
These are some documents analysing real attacks that have occurred, in varying depth.
- [Performing Your Own Attack And Analysis](performing-your-own-attack-and-analysis)\
This is an exercise in creating your own log collection system on a Linux machine, then attacking the machine and analysing the logs created.

We also wrote some thoughts about the [commercial tools](commercial-tools-experience) we used in the course, which will hopefully provide some information about them to those who are interested in them but do not have access to them.
