This is a reflection on our experiences using some commercial tools during the course. Unfortunately we will not provide screenshots as we were using real systems, however the product websites have screenshots and information on them. For the same reason we will only give a high level overview of our process and what we thought of the product, not any of the information we found in the systems. Note that these are based on the features we used, and as we did not spend much time with them they are likely a very small subset of the product.

## [LogRhythm](logrhythm)

We primarily used LogRhythm to search through logs and see what alarms were triggered.

## [Exabeam](exabeam)

We used Exabeam alongside LogRhythm to look at users at a higher level. Exabeam identifies suspicious activity automatically so is a lot easier to use than raw logs.

## [AttackIQ](attackiq)

We used AttackIQ to run test attacks on a system to see what techniques would work against the defenses.
