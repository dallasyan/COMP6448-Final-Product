Throughout the course we used the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) extensively. A lot of documents here will reference it so it will be useful to familiarise yourself with it. 

Essentially it provides an easy way to communicate attack techniques to other analysts by grouping them under different codes. These codes are then grouped under tactics which makes it easy to visualise attack steps and identify the attack's process and goals.

Their website contains some [exercies](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/training/cti/) to familiarise yourself with the framework and how it can be used.
