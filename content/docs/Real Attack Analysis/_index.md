We analysed the techniques used in some real world attacks, and looked at how attacks can evolve.

## [ANU](ANU)

An analysis of the Australian National University breach (provided to us), with comments mapping the techniques used to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## [SOFACY](SOFACY)

An analysis of the evolution of SOFACY's attacks using their playbook.

## [OilRig](OilRig)

OilRig is an Iranian threat group primarily targeting organisations in the Middle East. You can read more about them [here](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/oilrig).

UNIT42 has a very interesting article on OilRig [here](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/behind-the-scenes-with-oilrig/). It contains far more depth than any analysis we've done.
