In this exercise we took an analysis of the ANU breach, and mapped the techniques to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. This is a useful exercise as the ATT&CK framework can be used to easily communicate forms of attacks between analysts and creates a universal language to develop more effective cybersecurity.

The PDF below contains a timeline of the breach with comments added to identify the techniques used. The comments may not display properly on all browsers.
