COMP6448 Security Operations Masterclass is a course designed to expose students to real world security operations and incident response by engaging experts from AARNet Security Operations Centre.

Throughout the course we created some documents that may be useful in learning about cyber attacks and how to effectively run a security operations centre. They can be accessed [here](/docs/).
